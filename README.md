# 🧠 Machine Learning & Deep Learning Roadmap by Rakesh Suvvari

Welcome to the **ML-DL** repository — a hands-on journey through the most important **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** algorithms, concepts, and code demos.

This repo is designed for students, beginners, and professionals looking to **learn by doing**, with clean and minimal examples implemented using Python and popular libraries like `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, and `PyTorch`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RakeshSuvvari/ML-DL.git
cd ML-DL
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: For deep learning scripts using TensorFlow, Python 3.10 or lower is recommended.

---

## 🧪 Run Examples

* Navigate to the specific folder (e.g., `MachineLearning/3.Logistic_Regression.py`) and run the script:

```bash
python path/to/script.py
```

* Jupyter Notebooks are also included for some visualizations and experiments.

---

## 🌟 Learning Goals

* Understand **core ML/DL concepts** with hands-on code
* Learn how algorithms work **under the hood**
* Build **real-world ready models**
* Gain experience with libraries like `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `tensorflow`, and `transformers`
